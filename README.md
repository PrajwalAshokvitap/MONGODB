The Job/Internship Portal for Students is a web application designed to help students discover, view, and apply for jobs or internships posted by companies or placement cells. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for posting and browsing job listings, and stores all data securely in a MongoDB database.

The goal of this project is to build a real-world job board platform with CRUD operations, database integration, and frontend interaction â€” ideal for learning full-stack web development using the MERN stack or basic MongoDB with Node.js.
